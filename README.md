# Brickball
A breakball variant to get me more into the Bevy framework.

This is a learning project to get more aknowledge with the [bevy game engine](https://bevyengine.org/). It is neither feature complete or playbable until now.

I started by display and moving the player paddel. After that I added the ball and walls. Now I added extended keyboard control over the elements. So you can use the following keys to control the game: 

* Cursor keys - controls the player paddle (or the ball)
* Space bar - unlocks the ball from paddle (game starts)
* F1 - toggles between paddle or ball control
* -/+ - changes the ball speed
* Shift+C - centers the ball on field (only when ball control is activated)
* R - resets the ball 
* Esc - exits the game
