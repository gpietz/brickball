# Brickball
A breakball variant to get me more into the Bevy framework.

This is a learning project to get more aknowledge with the [bevy game engine](https://bevyengine.org/). It is neither feature complete or playbable until now.

I started by display and moving the player paddel. After that I added the ball and walls. Now I added extended keyboard control over the elements. So you can use the following keys to control the game: 

<table>
<tr>
<td>Cursor keys</td>
<td>Controls the player paddle (or the ball).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Space bar</td>
<td>Unlocks the ball from paddle (game starts).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>F1</td>
<td>Toggles between paddle or ball control.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>F2</td>
<td>Prints the ball and paddle coordinates.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>- / +</td>
<td>changes the ball speed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Shift+C</td>
<td>Centers the ball on the field (only when ball control is activated).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>R</td>
<td>Resets the ball; locks it again on the paddle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Esc</td>
<td>Exits the game.</td>
</tr>
</table>
